planetool is the main file
it uses:
- planetcalendar.py to create a calendar 
- orbit2D.py to create a figure with the orbits (orbit3D also exists)

You need to have the planets package installed to use this routine
https://github.com/aymeric-spiga/planets
 
In planetool you only have to choose :
- if you want to create a calendar, a figure of orbits or both (on/off)
- if calendar is selected : 
     --> date of departure
     --> date of arrival
     --> timestep in Earth days 

At the end of the planetcalendar.py routine, you can add different plots.
An example is given, with the ecolution of declination with time
