planetool is the main file
it uses:
- planetcalendar.py to create a calendar 
- orbit2D.py to create a figure with the orbits (orbit3D also exists)

You need to have the planets package installed to use this routine
https://github.com/aymeric-spiga/planets
 
In planetool you only have to choose :
- if you want to create a calendar, a figure of orbits or both (on/off)
- if calendar is selected : 
     --> date of departure
     --> date of arrival
     --> timestep in Earth days 

At the end of the planetcalendar.py routine, you can add different plots.
An example is given, with the evolution of declination with time

Example of use :
- open planetool
- add your planet : 
      myplanet1=planets.Saturn
- select your calendar options : departure date, final date, day step
      date11=datetime(2000, 1, 1, 00, 00, 00)
      date12=datetime(2010, 2, 7, 00, 00, 00)
      day_step1 = 1   # step for calendar in Earth days
- make sure to call the calendar routine :
      cal(myplanet1,date11,date12,day_step1)

- run planetool : ./planetool
